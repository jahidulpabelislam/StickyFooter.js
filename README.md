## What? 
A small library to create a sticky footer effect using JavaScript & jQuery.

If the length of the normal/original height of the page is smaller than the height of the window, the library  will then extent the 'main content' element to to fill the remaining space.

## Why?
I had decided to create this library as I has found my self creating and using this effect/code in all my projects, so thought it will be nice to have it in one place only.
This way maintenance all use of this effect can be done easily. While also helping the developer community, with this nice small helper library for the front-end.
